## Type systems

* Basic integer types, inference and explicit conversion (ABI)
* Floating point types, both 32-bit and 64-bit
* Compound types

## Language features

* Compiler directive to support different ABI
* Polymorphism
* Ensure inline
* Carefully defined undefined behaviour
* Easy to use standard library

## Library

* Should be able to use external C/C++ library
* Should be able to use this language to write a library

## Static analysis

* Pointer ownership?
* Address santinizer

## Build system

* Metaprogram the compiler to build the program
* Customizable compiler options like installation path and so on
* Compilation unit, incremental builds or unity builds?

## Compile-time execution

* Bytecode interpreter

## Custom backend

* RISC-V backend
* IR design
* Basic optimizations
* Drop some thoughts on code size
